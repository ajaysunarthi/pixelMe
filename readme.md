I am always fascinated with the background images with small pixel overlay styles in it.

Creating those styles in photoshop,CSS is easy.But CSS is just filter based overlay and it does not change the image.

So I am making a small effort to create the same effects using javascript and HTML5 canvas element.

The idea is to get the image pixels using canvas. And for the given tile size average out the color and put those pixels into circular or rectangular form based on tile type.

Choose any of your local images and test out the effects.
